## How to Update Code

1. Pull the latest changes: Run the following Git command to fetch the latest updates from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch:
```bash
  git pull origin main
```
  (Note: Replace main with the appropriate branch name if you're working with a different one.)

2. Resolve conflicts (if any): If there are merge conflicts, resolve them manually in your code editor, then stage the changes:
```bash
  git add .
```
3. Commit your changes (if you made updates to the code): Once your changes are resolved and staged, commit the updates:
```bash
  git commit -m "Updated code with latest changes"
```
### Warning ⚠️ PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU PUSH TO BRANCH NOT "MAIN" ⚠️
4. Push your changes (if necessary): After committing, if you need to push your updates back to the remote repository, use:
```bash
  git push origin main
```
